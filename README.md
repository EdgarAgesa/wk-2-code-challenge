## Description
In this section we are using Java Script to write three functions:
1.Swaps case characters
It swaps case characters for every letter provided.It uses the function caseChanger(input)to implement the code.For example if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox' the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.
2.Generate arrays between numbers
It accepts two numbers and generates the numbers between the selected numbers in an orderly manner.For example if you input 4 and 7 the output will be '4,5,6 and 7'.
3.Returns prime numbers between an array of given numbers
It takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array.
